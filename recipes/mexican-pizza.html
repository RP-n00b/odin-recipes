    <h2>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Mexican Pizza is a fusion dish which combines 
        both Italian and Mexican cuisines, with a stronger 
        emphasis on the Mexican taste.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>3 cups skim milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>5 ounces lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup red chile sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup Mexican shredded cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 tomato, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sliced pitted black olives</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
    </ul>  
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir cornmeal, milk, and salt together in a medium saucepan, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens enough to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the olive oil. Spread on a greased cookie sheet. Cool in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake polenta crust in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in red chile sauce, and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top polenta crust with meat sauce and cheese. Return to the oven; bake until cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Top with lettuce, tomato, black olives, and sour cream. Sprinkle with additional shredded cheese, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
